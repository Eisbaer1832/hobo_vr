# c++ bindings for hobo_vr posers
## usage
include `virtualreality.h`
then use `hvr::UduPoserTemplate` as a parent class, further documentation coming soon :tm:

## compiling
has no external dependencies yet, will have `docopt` soon

just compile it any way you see fit with c++17 or higher

all the source files are in `virtualreality/`, you'll need all of them
