# Contributions
only 2 requirements: format your commit messages and format your PR messages

see the details below

*enforcement will not be strict, but it is encouraged to follow these guidelines*

## commit message format
your commit messages should follow this format

```diff
path: to: the: file/files: <commit title>
<commit message>

# optional on normal commits, but if you edited someone else's commit you need to add this
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@mail.provider>


# text after '#' symbol is a comment and is not a part of the commit message

```

OR

```
path: to: the: folder/folders: <commit title>
<commit message>

# optional on normal commits, but if you edited someone else's commit you need to add this
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@mail.provider>


# text after '#' symbol is a comment and is not a part of the commit message
```

also your commits need to have a body, only a title is not enough, no matter how small the change is describe the changes in the commit message

## PR message format
your PR messages should follow this format

```
<PR title>

<description of the changes>

<weather or not its tested and if it is testing notes>

<other notes>

```
